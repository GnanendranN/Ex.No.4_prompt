### REGISTER NUMBER : 212223240037
# Aim: 
To write the prompt for the following prompt types and compare that with differenet AI tools and evaluate that using any one evaluation method (eg. Rubrics).  
- Comparative Analysis Prompt  
- Experiential Perspective Prompt  
- Everyday Functioning Prompts  
- Universal Prompt Structures Prompt Refinements  
- Prompt Size Limitations design an AI  

# Procedure:
## **1. Scenario and Use Case:**
**Scenario:**
A university is planning to design an AI-powered Learning Assistant to support students in academics and campus life. The assistant should help students:

- Compare different learning resources,

- Share experiences from a student’s perspective,

- Assist in everyday functioning like schedules and budgeting,

- Refine vague queries into meaningful structured prompts,

- Generate concise outputs when size limitations are imposed.

**Use Case:**
This scenario ensures that prompt design covers real-world student needs. By applying different prompt types, the AI can be evaluated for clarity, depth, creativity, and practicality in an educational setting.

## 2. Prompt Patterns for Each Design Aspect:
**a. Comparative Analysis Prompt**

**Definition:** Asking the AI to compare two or more options, showing similarities, differences, pros, and cons.

**Example Prompt:**  
``` 
Compare online courses from Coursera, edX, and Udemy for learning Data Science.
Present pros, cons, and cost-benefit analysis in a table.
```
**AI-Generated Answer (Sample):**

| Platform | Pros                                        | Cons                             | Cost-Benefit                      |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Coursera | University-certified, structured curriculum | More expensive                   | High value for formal credentials |
| edX      | Ivy League content, strong theory base      | Less practical projects          | Best for academic learners        |
| Udemy    | Affordable, flexible, wide variety          | Quality varies, less recognition | Great for beginners on a budget   |

**b. Experiential Perspective Prompt**

**Definition:** Asking the AI to simulate experiences or role-play, expressing emotions and personal viewpoints.

**Example Prompt:**
“Imagine you are a first-year engineering student attending a hackathon. Describe your excitement, challenges, and what you learned.”

**AI-Generated Answer (Sample):**
> Walking into the hackathon hall, I felt both nervous and thrilled. The energy was contagious — laptops buzzing, whiteboards filled with ideas. My biggest challenge was coordinating with a team I just met, but by the end, I learned how collaboration and persistence can turn a raw idea into a working prototype. I walked away exhausted, yet inspired to keep building.

**c. Everyday Functioning Prompt**

**Definition:** Asking the AI to support users in managing day-to-day academic or personal tasks.

**Example Prompt:**
```
Help a college student plan their day: 2 hours of study, 1 hour of gym, attending a class at 4 PM, and preparing for a test tomorrow. Suggest an optimal schedule.
```

**AI-Generated Answer (Sample):**

> 8:00–10:00 AM → Study session (focused revision)  
> 10:30–11:30 AM → Gym workout  
> 12:00–1:00 PM → Lunch + short rest  
> 1:30–3:30 PM → Test preparation (problem-solving)  
> 4:00–5:00 PM → Class  
> 6:00–7:00 PM → Light review and notes  

**d. Universal Prompt Structures (Prompt Refinement)**

**Definition:** Asking the AI to improve vague queries into more useful structured prompts.

**Example Prompt:**
```
‘Tell me about AI.’
```
- Refine this into a clear, structured prompt, then answer it.

**Refined Prompt:** 
```
Explain the history, applications, and future scope of Artificial Intelligence in education.
```

**AI-Generated Answer (Sample):**
> AI in education began with early tutoring systems in the 1970s, evolved into adaptive learning platforms, and today powers tools like plagiarism checkers and chatbots. Applications include personalized learning, grading automation, and predictive analytics. In the future, AI may enable fully adaptive curricula tailored to individual students’ learning speeds.

**e. Prompt Size Limitations**

**Definition:** Designing prompts that require the AI to deliver concise yet complete responses.

**Example Prompt:**
```
Summarize the book ‘The Lean Startup’ in under 80 words, highlighting the core idea.
```

**AI-Generated Answer (Sample):**
> The Lean Startup by Eric Ries promotes building businesses through continuous innovation. Instead of long plans, entrepreneurs should create minimum viable products, test them with users, and iterate quickly. By learning from failures early, startups reduce waste and increase chances of success. The core idea is ‘build–measure–learn’ as a cycle for sustainable growth.

## Evaluation Using Rubric Method

**Rubric Dimensions (score 1–5)**
- Clarity (understandable, structured)
- Depth (insightful, detailed)
- Creativity (novel perspectives)
- Practicality (usable in real scenarios)

| **AI Tool** | **Clarity** | **Depth** | **Creativity** | **Practicality** | **Avg.** |
| ----------- | ----------- | --------- | -------------- | ---------------- | -------- |
| **GPT-5**   | 5           | 5         | 4              | 5                | **4.75** |
| **Claude**  | 5           | 4         | 5              | 4                | **4.5**  |
| **Gemini**  | 4           | 4         | 3              | 5                | **4.0**  |
| **LLaMA**   | 3           | 3         | 2              | 3                | **2.75** |
